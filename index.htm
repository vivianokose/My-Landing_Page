    <!-- About Project Section -->
    <section id="about-project">
        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>The idea for Book Haven came from my love for reading and the difficulty I faced finding a single platform that offers a diverse range of books. This project started as a personal endeavor to create a haven for book lovers like myself. I wanted a place where people can find everything from the latest bestsellers to rare indie books, all in one place.</p>
        <p>This journey began in early 2024, and it has been a fulfilling experience balancing my passion for books with my skills in software development. This project also serves as a Portfolio Project for Holberton School, showcasing the skills I've acquired during my time there.</p>
